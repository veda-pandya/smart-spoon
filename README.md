# SmartSpoon

## Project Overview

This meal planning and recipe management app helps users browse a wide range of recipes by either selecting ingredients they already have at home or based on specific preferences such as dietary needs, cuisine, and meal type. The app empowers users to stay organized by creating personalized meal plans, tracking nutrition goals, and minimizing food waste by making use of available ingredients. It provides an intuitive interface to manage meal prep while promoting sustainable cooking practices and a healthy lifestyle.

## Key Features

- **Custom UI Design**: Visually appealing and user-friendly interface, including a custom logo for a cohesive and professional brand identity.

- **Comprehensive Recipe Search & Filters**: Browse a large recipe database with advanced filtering by dietary restrictions, nutrition preferences, cuisine, meal type, and cooking time.

- **Ingredient-Based Recipe Search**: Input available ingredients to receive tailored recipe suggestions, with detailed ingredient availability and substitution information.

- **Adjustable Servings**: Dynamically adjust servings, updating ingredient quantities and nutritional information for accurate portions and calorie counts.

- **Custom Recipe Book**: Save favorite or custom recipes to a personalized recipe book, stored in local storage for data persistence.

- **Meal Planning**: Plan meals up to four weeks in advance, track daily calories and macros, and easily add, remove, or move meals within the planner.

- **Custom Meal Entries**: Log non-recipe meals (e.g., "ate out" or "leftovers") for flexible nutritional tracking.

- **Autocomplete Functionality**: Speed up recipe and ingredient searches with intuitive autocomplete suggestions.

## Technologies Used

- HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Libraries**: flatpickr (date selection), pluralize (pluralization)
- **APIs**: Spoonacular (recipe and nutrition data)
- Parcel (bundling and packaging), Babel (JavaScript transpiling)
- Netlify (hosting)

- **MVC Architecture** (Model-View-Controller) for organizing code and ensuring separation of concerns
- **Fully Responsive Design**: Optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile, adapting seamlessly to different screen sizes
- **Accessibility**: Built with accessibility in mind, adhering to WCAG guidelines. Keyboard navigation, ARIA attributes, and screen reader support to ensure inclusivity.
- **BEM (Block Element Modifier)** for organizing CSS into reusable, maintainable components
- **Local Storage** for data persistence across sessions
