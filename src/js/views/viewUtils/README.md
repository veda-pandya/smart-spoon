# View Utilities Folder

This folder contains utility files that are used across the view files. There are two subfolders:

1. **`highLevel/`**: Contains general-purpose utility functions that can be used by any part of the view layer (e.g., `viewUtils.js`) , including in featureSpecific utility files.

2. **`featureSpecific/`**: Contains utilities related to specific views (e.g., recipeDetailsModalUtils.js to support the rendering of the Recipe Details Modal View).

These files provide shared logic that helps in keeping the view layer clean and modular, promoting reusability, scalability and maintainability.
